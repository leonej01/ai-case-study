# Module 1 Challenge / AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Figure AI, Sunnydale, California \
Incorporated 2022 \
Brett Adcock, Founder, CEO

* The company aims to create affordable and practical humanoid robotics.  

* The company has secured a total of $79 million in funding to date: 
  - 70 million in April 2023 from lead investor Parkway Venture
  - 9 million in July 2023 from lead investors Intel Capital

## Business Activities

The company's primary focus is on bi-pedal humanoid robotics. In a Techcrunch interview (Heater, 20023) company founder Brett Adock believes that
  > humanoids will revolutionize a variety of industries, from corporate labor roles, to assisting individuals in the home, to caring for the elderly, to building new worlds on other planets. 

Figure AI's strategy is to to develop their AI models by initally focusing on the maufacturing industry which is highly organized, standardized and employ repetitive tasks.  This focus will allow them to generate income as quickly as possible before they start work on consumer facing humanoids. 

There are two sets of general customers: 
1. Industries such manufacturing, warehousing, shipping & logistics, and retail where humaniods will address labor shortages. 
2. The general public where humanoids will work alongside people to assit with undesirable, dangerous, and monotonous tasks. 

Like many companies, Figure AI has had to overcome supply chain issues as well as subpar materials to meet their needs. In order to achieve high reliability, safety and high performance standards, they reluctantly made the choice to build many key materials from scratch; These include motors, actuators, sensors, battery packs and other types of electronics.

The robot can be seen as a composite of multiple systems, that use computing, operating systems, AI systems and control algorithms.  firmware, employs mechanical design, with battery systems, motors, actuators, battery packs and other types of electronics.

## Landscape

The company's business strategy is to get to market as soon as possible to start generating revenue. They will initially focus on the manufacturing industry because of its constraints such as high turnover, labor shortages, inherent dangers, and boring, repetitive tasks people generally do not like to do. One advantage of the manufacturing industry is that it is very structured which will help Figure AI develop the AI data engine that will be used to train the robot. They plan to later move into the consumer marketplace but realize that it will take millions of more dollars and years to bring the humanoid to the consumer marketplace at a reasonable price point. The robots will need to be more generalized to be able to operate in different homes and layouts, perform a variety of tasks with a variety of items it may grab and speak with humans across a multitude of languages. 

The advances in robotics and engineering has allowed Figure AI to create and execute their vision. There have been improvements in the energy and power density of the motors that drive the robots, particularly the electric actuators which allows them to build a light, high powered and high energy system. Large language models will enable the company to take the robots from the warehouse to the home. People will be able to interact with the robots through language to get them to complete tasks.

## Results

* Figure AI has not yet brought thier humanoid bi-pedal robot to market but aims to do so by 2024. Some of their performance targets include, a 5 hour runtime, a walking speed of 2 meters/second and the ablity to lift 20kg. There is no standard rubric for performace metrics but common measures include, cost, speed, weight, accuracy, reliability and safety. 

* Many humanoid robots exist with different capbilities and  purposes across a variety of settings. Figure AI's vision is to have 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
