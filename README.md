# Module 1 Challenge / AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Figure AI, Sunnydale, California \
Incorporated 2022 \
Brett Adcock, Founder, CEO

* The company aims to create affordable and practical humanoid robotics.  

* The company has secured a total of $79 million in funding to date: 
  - 70 million in April 2023 from lead investor Parkway Venture
  - 9 million in July 2023 from lead investors Intel Capital

## Business Activities

The company's primary focus is on bi-pedal humanoid robotics. In a Techcrunch interview (Heater, 2023), company founder Brett Adcock believes that
  > humanoids will revolutionize a variety of industries, from corporate labor roles, to assisting individuals in the home, to caring for the elderly, to building new worlds on other planets. 

Figure AI's strategy is to to develop their AI models by initially focusing on the manufacturing industry which is highly organized, standardized and employs repetitive tasks.  This focus will allow them to generate income as quickly as possible before they start work on consumer facing humanoids. 

There are two sets of general customers: 
1. Industries such manufacturing, warehousing, shipping & logistics, and retail where humanoids will address labor shortages. 
2. The general public where humanoids will work alongside people to assist with undesirable, dangerous, and monotonous tasks. 

Like many companies, Figure AI has had to overcome supply chain issues as well as subpar materials to meet their needs. In order to achieve high reliability, safety and high performance standards, they reluctantly made the choice to build many key materials from scratch; These include motors, actuators, sensors, battery packs and other types of electronics.

The robot can be seen as a composite of many types of technologies, many with their own systems that must integrate as a whole for the robot to function. Some of technologies used by the humanoid include: mechanical engineering, electronics, computers, AI systems, such as machine learning, natural language processing and  computer vision. 

## Landscape

The company's business strategy is to get to market as soon as possible to start generating revenue. They will initially focus on the manufacturing industry because of its constraints such as high turnover, labor shortages, inherent dangers, and boring, repetitive tasks people generally do not like to do. One advantage of the manufacturing industry is that it is very structured which will help Figure AI develop the AI data engine that will be used to train the robot. They plan to later move into the consumer marketplace but realize that it will take millions of more dollars and years to bring the humanoid to the consumer marketplace at a reasonable price point. The robots will need to be more generalized to be able to operate in different homes and layouts, perform a variety of tasks with a variety of items it may grab and speak with humans across a multitude of languages. 

The advances in robotics and engineering has allowed Figure AI to create and execute their vision. There have been improvements in the energy and power density of the motors that drive the robots, particularly the electric actuators which allows them to build a light, high powered and high energy system. Large language models will enable the company to take the robots from the warehouse to the home. People will be able to interact with the robots through language to get them to complete tasks. 

Other Humanoid Robotic Companies include
- Hanson Robotics
- Boston Dynamics
- PAL Robotics
- UBTECH Robotics
- Agility Robotics


## Results

* Figure AI has not yet brought their humanoid bi-pedal robot to market but aims to do so by 2024. Some of their performance targets include, a 5 hour runtime, a walking speed of 2 meters/second and the ability to lift 20kg. There is no standard rubric for performance metrics but common measures include, cost, speed, weight, accuracy, reliability and safety. 

* Many humanoid robots exist with different capabilities and purposes across a variety of settings. One very well known and high performing humanoid is called Atlas from Boston Dynamics and has received a lot of recent attention for it's sleek design, ability to do somersaults and backflips, carrying up 80 kg loads at over 6 miles/hr and navigate extreme terrains. 

## Recommendations

* Thinking about the capabilities of robots, I would suggest for Figure AI to use them in a healthcare setting as a way finder. I have observed firsthand, many, many patients having difficulty finding their way. At very large healthcare institutions, patients often get confused about who they are seeing or what service they are there for and then where to go. On top of dealing with illness, this can be very distressing for patients. It's usually not enough to provide directions but for a robot to actually escort a patient to their destination could help relieve some stress and get patients to the correct location and on time!

* US Healthcare comprised over 18.3% of US GDP in 2021. While many advances have been made to Telehealth visits and remote patient monitoring, patients are still visiting doctors offices and healthcare institutions for their care. Way finding is a very specific and narrow function that may just require updates to maps to allow for accurate navigation. If robots do not currently use Global Positioning Systems (GPS), that is an additional technology that could enhance the way finding capabilities. Many electronic health records and hospital security systems capture patient facial images for facial recognition. To personalize the patient experience, the robot could access the patient data base to view and recognize the patient to address the patient by their name and search the electronic health record for appointment information to assist the patient even further.
