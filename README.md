# ai-case-study
**Background**

As an AI professional, it is critical to learn how AI companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the AI space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape, as many AI companies create tools and technologies that are then used by other companies.

One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the case study. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused case study that analyzes how an AI company responds to the problems and needs of the AI field it is in, and how it is using AI technology to solve a standing problem.
In this Challenge, you will:
* Select an AI field that interests you, and then choose a company or project within that field.
* Research the field and company.
* Write a detailed case study of the company.
* Upload your case study to your Git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your AI research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that AI professionals use to evaluate the industry. It will also help you practice using the AI foundational skills you have learned in this lesson, including GitHub, Terminal, Anaconda, and virtual environments. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about AI strategy and technology.

**Before You Begin**

Before starting the challenge, be sure to complete the following steps:
1. Create a new repository for this project called ai-case-study. Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
   
**Instructions Part 1: Choose a Company (or Project) in an AI Field That You Find Relevant or Interesting.**

We covered a number of AI fields in class this week. Consider choosing from the following:
- Finance
- Business
- Medicine
- Daily life

Remember that because AI is expected to impact nearly every aspect of our lives, this is by no means a comprehensive list. You are free to choose any field for your case study, as long as it is being disrupted by AI.

Use online research to identify the trends in your field and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. For example, if you choose the field of finance, you may want to narrow your search by looking at online journals, periodicals, reports, and websites about the future of wealth management, or how AI is changing or disrupting wealth management.

Your company could be:
* A new, emerging AI company that is doing well in a particular field. Examples include HighRadius, Jasper, Moveworks, OpenAI, and Tempus.
* A large incumbent technology company that is doing something interesting with new, emerging AI technology. Examples include Amazon, GitHub, Google, and Microsoft.
* A smaller start-up that is not yet wildly successful, but that you find promising and interesting. This may include an AI company in your local area or a company with a new idea that you would like to learn more about.

**Instructions Part 2: Conduct your Research Using the Case Study Template as a Guide.**

We recommend that you use the case study template below in order to focus your research. You may lengthen, shorten, or – if necessary – remove sections from the template to accommodate the information available about your company.
